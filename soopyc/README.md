# Sophie's solutions and inputs

~~As with last year, I'm doing this with (n)vim as much as possible. Autocomplete tools such as Copilot has not been installed.~~

Somehow messed up my vim config completely, doing that is not possible anymore. Using vscode without copilot.

## How to run?
I use poetry to manage my dependencies. Either install that, or install dephell and do the install thing. Afterwards,
activate the venv (if it made one) and then run the script like how you normally would. (`python script.py`)
